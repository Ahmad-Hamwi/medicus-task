## A simple, android task demonstrating couple of technologies in-demand.

The task requires fetching for data from an api, showing the data in a list, navigation, multi themeing, error handling, animations, and more.

## Technologies used:

- Clean Architecture (As described in the [`Uncle's Bob Blog Post`](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)).
- Depenedency Injection using [`Dagger Hilt`](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).
- Repository with Datasources pattern.
- MVVM using [`Android ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) and [`LiveData`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) for data lifecycle-aware observation.
- Kotlin [`Flow`](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) and Kotlin [`Coroutines`](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) for data streaming, asynchronous programming with error handling.
- [`ViewBinding`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) and [`DataBinding`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) for data integration with customized UI.
